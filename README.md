here's ponggers2, mainly a tech demo to show off the trig functions, fps display, texture and font conversion, texture and text (with the custom fonts) drawing with shader support.

you can use those functions in your own programs or whatever

documentation and instructions are inside the individual .hpp and .py files

oh also you probably need to install Python Pillow for image stuff
